I'm building Nunzio, a conversational workout tracking assistant that runs locally. Here's the technical context:

PROJECT: Nunzio - Local Workout Assistant
GOAL: Build a Telegram bot that logs workouts, recommends exercises, and chats about fitness goals using local LLMs

TECH STACK:
- Python 3.13+ (use modern features: match/case, type hints, async/await)
- python-telegram-bot (async) - for Telegram interface
- ollama (async client) - connects to local Ollama at http://odysseus:11434
- instructor (Pydantic-based structured outputs from LLM)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ async with mysql-connector-python using the .aio package - MySQL 8.4 connection
- MySQL on odysseus (host: odysseus, user: nunzio, db: nunzio_workouts) 
- The application will run inisde a podman container and connect to MySQL and Ollama on the external host

ARCHITECTURE:
- Repository pattern for all DB access
- Instructor pattern for LLM structured extraction (IntentClassifier, WorkoutExtractor)
- ConversationManager handles intent routing
- Simple rule-based recommendation engine (v1)

DATA MODEL:
- Exercise(id, name, muscle_group)
- WorkoutSession(id, date, notes, created_at)
- WorkoutSet(id, session_id, exercise_id, set_number, reps, weight, notes)

CONVERSATIONAL FLOW:
1. User sends message to Telegram bot
2. Classify intent (log_workout, get_recommendation, chat, view_stats)
3. Extract structured data if needed (exercise, sets, reps, weight, notes)
4. Save to MySQL or generate response
5. Reply conversationally

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
- Start with database layer and models
- Build LLM integration next (Instructor + Ollama)
- Wire up Telegram bot last
- Single user (me), so no auth complexity
- Prefer new Python features, state-of-the-art patterns

Let's start by creating the project structure and SQLAlchemy async models. Create:
1. pyproject.toml with dependencies
2. src/nunzio/ package structure
3. src/nunzio/database/models.py with async SQLAlchemy models
4. src/nunzio/database/repository.py with async CRUD operations

Use asyncio, typed annotations, and clear docstrings. Questions, or are we ready?
